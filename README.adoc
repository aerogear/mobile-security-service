== Overview

This is the server component of the AeroGear Mobile Security Service. It is a RESTful API that allows developers to view, enable and disable specific versions of applications on demand, with the information stored in a PostgreSQL database.

== Prerequisites

.Prerequisites
|===
|https://golang.org/doc/install[Install Golang]
|https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH[Ensure the $GOPATH environment variable is set]
|https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Install the dep package manager]
|https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Install Docker and Docker Compose]
|===

See the https://aerogear.org/community/#guides[Contributing Guide] for more information.

== Getting Started

If you'd like to simply run the entire application in `docker-compose`, follow link:#Run-Entire-Application-with-Docker-Compose[these instructions].

Golang projects are kept in a https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces[workspace] that follows a very specific architecture. Before cloning this repo, be sure you have a `$GOPATH` environment variable set up.

:numbered:
=== Clone the Repository

[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:aerogear/mobile-security-service.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service
----

=== Install Dependencies

[source,shell]
----
make setup
----

NOTE: This is using the `dep` package manager under the hood. You will see the dependencies installed in the `vendor` folder.

=== Start the Server

[source,shell]
----
go run cmd/mobile-security-service/main.go
----

=== Run Entire Application with Docker Compose

This section shows how to start the entire application with `docker-compose`. This is useful for doing some quick tests (using the SDKs) for example.

First, compile a Linux compatible binary:

[source,shell]
----
go build -o mobile-security-service cmd/mobile-security-service/main.go
----

This binary will be used to build the Docker image. Now start the entire application.

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose up
----

== Setup and configurations

=== Environment Variables

The **mobile-security-service** is configured using environment variables.

* By default, the application will look for system environment variables to use.
* If a system environment variable cannot be found, the application will then check the `.env` file in the application root.
* If the `.env` file does not exist, or if the variable is not defined in the file, the application will use the default value defined in link:./pkg/config/config.go[config.go].

=== Add your own .env file

Make a copy of the example file `.env.example`.

[source,shell]
----
cp .env.example .env
----

Now the application will use the values defined in `.env`.

=== Server Configuration

.Server Configuration
|===
| *Variable* | *Default* | *Description*
| PORT                             | 3000    | The port the server will listen on
| LOG_LEVEL                        | info    | Can be one of `[debug, info, warning, error, fatal, panic]`
| LOG_FORMAT                       | text    | Can be one of `[text, json]`
| ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN      | *       | Can be multiple URL values separated with commas. Example: `ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN=http://www.example.com,http://example.com`
| ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS | false   | Can be one of `[true, false]`
| DBMAX_CONNECTIONS                | 100     | The maximum number of concurrent database connections the server will open
|===

== Database

The database connection is configured using the table of environment variables below. These environment variables correspond to the PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html[libpq environment variables]. The table below shows all of the environment variables supported by the `pq` driver used in this server.

== Using Swagger UI

=== Method 1

A https://swagger.io/[Swagger] UI can be used for testing the mobile-security-service service.

[source,shell]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e API_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service/master/api/swagger.yaml swaggerapi/swagger-ui
----

The Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080].

=== Method 2

There is also a https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/swagger-ui-console/ljlmonadebogfjabhkppkoohjkjclfai?hl=en[Chrome extension] you can use instead of running a Docker container.

Paste https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service/master/api/swagger.yaml[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service/master/api/swagger.yaml] and press **Explore**.
